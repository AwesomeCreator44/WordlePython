# WordlePython
Basically Wordle but on python. Work In Progress!

Doesn't (currently) have a system for a different word each day like the actual wordle. Words are chosen at random and new words can be given as many times as you want.
List of words came from: https://www.ef.co.uk/english-resources/english-vocabulary/top-1000-words/ (stored in the WordAll.txt file)


First, the user chooses a number from 2-12, which will be the length of the words given to them.
They can then choose the difficulty:
  
  1 is normal - basically just normal wordle (unfinished)
  
  2 is difficult - wordle but you only get told the number of letters in common which are both already in the correct places and aren't in the right place as seperate counts (unfinished)
  
  3 is impossible - wordle but you only get told the number of letters in common which are already in the correct places


Future plans:

  Finish normal and difficult gamemodes

  Create a tkinter interface for the game.
