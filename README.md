# WordlePython
Basically Wordle but on python. Work In Progress!
Doesn't (currently) have a system for a different word each day. Words are chosen at random and new words can be given as many times as you want.
Will upload link of where I found the words.

First, the user chooses a number from 2-12, which will be the length of the words given to them.
They can then choose the difficulty:
  1 is easy - basically just normal wordle (unfinished)
  2 is moderate - wordle but harder (unfinished)
  3 is hard - wordle but you harder
